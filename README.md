# boniphace-essentials README

## Easy starting setup

Do you have several VSCode profiles?

Do some extensions appear in different profiles?

Have YOU tried to manage that?

"Oh, ohno, I forgot to install X in my Y profile!"

No more of that thanks to Boniphace Essentials!

The reason of being for this package is to ease setting up a new profile with basic extentions that are not usually bundled but that are really good together! If you see this pack, I hope you like and enjoy it!

>**None** of the extentions used are of my creation, credits to creators below.
>This is just a bundle.

## Extentensions I **love**

This are extensions I consider necessary for all my profiles:

- Markdown Extensions: to improve taking notes and writting documents.
  
    Markdown GITHUB STYLE thanks to Matt Bierner.

- Rainbow Indent: cause there's no point in trying to deduce indentation with the naked eye!

    May the gods of coding bless oderwat

- Path Intellisense: and don't get me started about having to figure out the path by yourself!

    Thanks to Christian Kobler my life is better!

- Pets, One Monokai and Material Icons: So you're never farm from home... and so that home is easy to the eye ;)
