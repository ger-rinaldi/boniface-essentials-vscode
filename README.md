# boniphace-essentials README

## Easy starting setup

Do you have several VSCode profiles?

Do some extensions appear in different profiles?

Have YOU tried to manage that?

"Oh, ohno, I forgot to install X in my Y profile!"

No more of that thanks to Boniphace Essentials!

The reason of being for this package is to ease setting up a new profile with basic extentions that are not usually bundled but that are really good together! If you see this pack, I hope you like and enjoy it!

>**None** of the extentions used are of my creation, credits to creators below.
>This is just a bundle.

## Extentensions I **love** and **need**

Packed with cool extentions you may find quite useful! This package is mainly focused in Markdown and PlantUML, these are extensions I find quite useful in, many profiles geared towards writing documentation or that need documentation capabilities!

## How to install

- Download the `.vsix` file (this is the installed for the package)

- Click on `Install from VSIX`

- Find your VSIX and click install and you're done!

In case you prefer not to install from the `.vsix` directly and you'd rather [make it yourself](https://medium.com/@sanik.bajracharya/vscode-how-to-create-your-own-extension-pack-483385644c29)
